Today we are going to discuss a particular class of hierarchical Bayesian models, which covers something like 90% of all important models out there. The examples of Latent Gaussian Models include, but not limited to, regression models, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, survival models, time series, spatial and spatio-temporal models. I hope to make a separate post about space-time models with details sometime in the future.

### Bayesian formulation

The Latent Gaussian Models (LGM) consist of 3 levels of hierarchy: observations $$y$$, latent field $$x$$ and hyperparameters $$\theta$$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{likelihood}:\quad& \pi(y|x,\theta)\\
    \text{latent prior}:\quad& \pi(x|\theta)\\
    \text{hyperprior}:\quad& \pi(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

Under this specification, we assume to observe $$y$$ conditioned on both latent parameters and hyperparameters. We are then interested in posterior distributions of parameters $$x$$ and $$\theta$$ given observations $$y$$, or more formally, in $$\pi(x,\theta\vert y)$$.

Using the Bayes theorem, we can express the posterior in the following way

$$
    \pi(x,\theta|y) \propto \pi(y|x,\theta)\pi(x|\theta)\pi(\theta)
$$
